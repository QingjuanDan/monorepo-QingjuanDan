# Exercises

Update your answers to the following questions, make sure to commit this file and your improved code as well!


## Task 1 - oop.py

1. Is MObject an abstract or a concrete class? Explain why:
	- MObject is a concrete class because it can be instantiated, and it is not defined as abstract, even though it doesnâ€™t have any implemented methods or attributes.

1. The 'Image' class has commented code for a `__del__` method. What does this commented-out method do?
	- ' __del__' method in the Image class would act as a destructor; it would define behavior for cleaning up resources or performing other necessary de-allocation actions when an object of the class is about to be destroyed by the garbage collector.

1. What class does Texture inherit from?
	- The `Texture` class inherits from the `Image` class.

1. What methods and attributes does the Texture class inherit from 'Image'? 
	- The `Texture` class inherits all methods (`__init__`, `getWidth`, `getHeight`, `getPixelColorR`, `getPixels`, `setPixelsToRandomValue`) and attributes (`m_width`, `m_height`, `m_colorChannels`, `m_Pixels`) from the `Image` class.

1. Do you think a texture should have a 'has-a' (composition) or 'is-a'(inheritance) relationship with 'Image'? If you think it is a 'has-a' relationship, refactor the code. As long as you defend your decision in the response below it could be either--but defend your position well!
	- I think a texture should have a 'has-a' relationship with 'Image', especially if we consider scenarios where a texture might have additional attributes and methods that are not applicable to a regular image, such as mapping methods, tiling, or wrapping modes.

	- We can refractor the code like this:
	```python
	class Texture:
    def __init__(self, w, h):
        self.image = Image(w, h)  # Texture has-an Image
    
    # Additional Texture-specific methods and attributes can be added here
	```
1. I did not declare a constructor for Texture. Does Python automatically create constructors for us? 
	- Yes, if we didn't declare a constructor for a class, Python will automatically use the constructor of its superclass. If none is found in any ancestor class, it defaults to the basic object constructor.

## Task 2 - Singleton

1. Refactor the singleton.py file such that:
  - The first time the logger is constructed, it will print out:
  	-  `Logger created exactly once`
  - If the logger is already initialized, it will print:
  	-  `logger already created`
Note: You do not 'have' a constructor, but you construct the object in the *instance* member function where you will create an object.  
Hint: Look at Lecture 3 slides for an example of creating a Singleton in Python

```python
class Logger:
    _instance = None  # Private class variable to hold the single instance

    def __new__(cls):
        if cls._instance is None:
            print("Logger created exactly once")
            cls._instance = super(Logger, cls).__new__(cls)
            cls._instance.messages = []  # Initialize messages attribute in the instance
        else:
            print("Logger already created")
        return cls._instance

    def add_message(self, message):
        self.messages.append(message)


def main():
    # Logger should only be initialized one time if it is properly
    # refactored as a singleton class
    for i in range(3):
        logger = Logger()
        logger.add_message(f"Adding message number: {i}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

1. Are singleton's in Python thread safe? Why or why not?

* Singletons in Python are not inherently thread-safe due to the possibility of multiple threads creating instances simultaneously. To make a Singleton thread-safe, we can use a locking mechanism like `threading.Lock` to synchronize instance creation, ensuring only one thread can create an instance at a time.

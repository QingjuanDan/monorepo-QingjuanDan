<hr>

**Use Case**: *Drawing with Mouse Left-Click*

**Primary Actor**: *user*

**Goal in Context**: *To draw on the canvas in a manner similar to using a pencil on paper*

**Preconditions**: *The drawing application is running and responsive, and a drawing color has been selected*

**Trigger**: *The user pressing and holding the left mouse button while moving the mouse*
  
**Scenario**: *The user positions the mouse cursor over the initial starting point on the canvas, then presses and keeps the left mouse button held down. While moving the mouse, the system modifies pixel colors on the canvas based on the path of the mouse cursor and the chosen color. The user can let go of the left mouse button to stop drawing.*
 
**Exceptions**: *If the user presses the space key when there is no previously selected color (i.e., they haven't chosen a color before), the application should provide feedback, such as an error message or a reminder to select a color first.*

**Priority**: *Medium*

**When available**: *first release*

**Channel to actor**: *The primary actor interacts with the system through keyboard input.*

**Secondary Actor**: *N/A*

**Channels to Secondary Actors**: *N/A*

**Open Issues**: *N/A*

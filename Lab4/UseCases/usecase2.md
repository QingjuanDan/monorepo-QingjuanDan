# Use Case 2

<hr>

**Use Case**: *Change drawing color by selecting different color keys*

**Primary Actor**: *user*

**Goal in Context**: *To allow the user to select different drawing colors using number keys*

**Preconditions**: *The drawing application is running and responsive*

**Trigger**: *The user pressing number keys 1 through 8*
  
**Scenario**: *1. When the user presses a number key from 1 to 8 to choose a color (as described in the use case), it signals a request to change the drawing color.
2. The application recognizes the key press and understands it as a color change request.
3. The application then updates the current drawing color to match the one associated with the pressed number key.
4. With the new color selected, the user can begin drawing on the canvas.
5. If the user wants to change the color again, they can follow the same steps by pressing another number key from 1 to 8.*
 
**Exceptions**: *The application may not recognize keypress events due to system lag. In such cases, the user should try pressing the key again*

**Priority**: *Medium*

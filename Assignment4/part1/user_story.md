User Story:

As a new user, I want to sign up for a PayPal account to complete secure online transactions and financial management.

Acceptance Criteria:

1. When I visit the PayPal website or app and select "Sign Up," I should be guided through a straightforward and intuitive registration process. It should ask for essential information without unnecessary complexity.

2. Upon completing the registration form and clicking "Sign Up," PayPal should promptly send a verification email to the address I provided. Clicking the link in the email should confirm my email and activate my account.

3. The registration process should enforce strong password standards, such as a minimum length, a mix of alphanumeric characters, and the option to include special characters. Clear instructions should be provided if my chosen password doesn't meet these criteria.

4. PayPal should validate that the email address I use for registration is unique and not associated with an existing PayPal account. If my email is already in use, a clear error message should prompt me to enter a different email address.

5. After email verification, I should be prompted to enhance my profile by providing additional details such as a phone number, address, and choosing security questions.

6. During registration, I should be presented with PayPal's terms and conditions and privacy policy. I should have the option to review and accept them before finalizing the registration.
